",Yes,"The implementation of FHE was already immensely beneficial on its own. However, improvement in terms of creating pro-active solutions in times of unforeseen circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic is highly demanded and solicited. Addressing the financial challenges requires collaborative efforts from governments, educational institutions, and community organizations to provide assistance and initiatives that help alleviate the financial burden of education, be it physical or virtual. This can include programs that provide subsidized or free internet access, device lending programs, and financial aid specifically targeted at supporting students and families facing economic difficulties.","The UAQTE had substantially minimized the financial strain on our household, which caused by having to pay for tuition fees and other similar school expenses. With the free education, the funds that were originally allocated for tuition fees have been otherwise used to fulfill relatively important needs, such as food and transportation allowance, apartment rent, etc.","
Amidst the pandemic, many students faced significant challenges in continuing their education due to the additional costs associated with online learning. The transition to virtual/remote schooling necessitated access to reliable internet connection, devices like computers, smartphones, or tablets, and the need for mobile data or broadband subscriptions. The cost of purchasing or upgrading devices and maintaining internet connectivity placed an extra burden on families already struggling with financial constraints. Personally, having a stable internet connection became a challenge with constant switching from Wi-Fi to mobile data just to keep up with the synchronous classes as well as other school deadlines. ","Communicating with instructors and informing them about the connectivity challenges was the most ideal way, although not essentially to cope with the issue, but rather in order to meet halfway and create alternative provisions, such as providing alternative submission methods, offering recorded lectures, or finding other solutions to support participation in classes.","While there may be challenges to address, such as funding and ensuring quality education, the concept of free education holds promise for creating a more equitable and inclusive society where education is accessible to all, regardless of financial background.
